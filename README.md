# Microtrap Electroporation
The Comsol models used to simulate microtrap electroporation is provided here. The models were created using Comsol 5.6 and are provided here as .m files which could be run using the Comsol-Matlab livelink. The following models are provided in this page:
1. Distribution of electric field in the microtrap array (2D electric field distribution).
2. The parametric sweep of 3D time dependent bulk electroporation model using asymptotic model of electroporation.
3. The parametric sweep of 3D time dependent micro-trap electroporation model using asymtotic model of electroporation.
