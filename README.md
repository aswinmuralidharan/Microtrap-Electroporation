# Microtrap Electroporation
The Comsol models used to simulate microtrap electroporation are provided here. The models were created using Comsol 5.6 and are provided here as .m files, which can be executed using the Comsol-Matlab Livelink. The following models are provided on this page:
1. Distribution of electric field in the microtrap array (2D electric field distribution).
2. The parametric sweep of the 3D time-dependent bulk electroporation model using the asymptotic model of electroporation.
3. The parametric sweep of the 3D time-dependent micro-trap electroporation model using the asymptotic model of electroporation.
